tfr.quest0.name=The Stone Age
tfr.quest0.desc=Make yourself the 4 basic tools with the rocks you found!
tfr.quest1.name=Clay
tfr.quest1.desc=Unlike vanilla, the clay blocks are covered by grass in this pack. But you can spot them with the goldenrod growing on top, a pretty yellow flower. Go get a ton of them! (not the flower, of course)
tfr.quest2.name=Pottery
tfr.quest2.desc=Now it's time to make some pottery using the same interface you used to make stone tool heads. To open the clay molding GUI, you must right-click with five or more clay clumps in hand. The raw clay products need to be fired into finished ceramics before they can be used. You may wonder how to do it.  You need a "pit kiln". %n%nSteps:%n1.Dig a 1x1x1 dirt pit, then shift-right click to place 4 clay items you want to fire. Shift right click again with an empty hand to pick them back up. %n2. Have 8 pieces of straw in your hand and right click the bottom of the pit until the pit is half full. Aim at the ground, not the item. %n3. Fill in 8 pieces of wood on the straw until the pit is full and light it with the fire starter. %n4. Once the fire burns out, you can collect your ceramics by hand, or simply break the bottom of the klin to collect everything. %n%nAn important thing to understand is that the flame burning on a clay kiln ignites nearby flammable blocks. For this reason, it is not recommended to set up the klin in houses made of wood, hay or other flammable materials. However, the kiln will not be extinguished by the rain.
tfr.quest3.name=§ §b§l"Novosibirsk" grows potatoes
tfr.quest3.desc=In 1859, Pan Galactic GregTech Technology Co., Ltd. initiated the interstellar colonization program. You are a technical engineer on a spaceship that has been dormant for 200 years and has arrived in the Terrafirma galaxy. Unfortunately, the starship failed to slow down as it approached its target planet: Terrafirma B, also known as The Duck Egg (named after one of the team members). Before the ship breaks up, you put on an spacesuit and board an escape capsule, crash-landing in the middle of a wilderness on the Duck Egg's largest moon, The Mountain Star, which you call "Novosibirsk". All your materials are lost with the destruction of the mothership, so all you have left is your intelligence and your nerve implant -- "Nerve Explorer Injected (NEI)" search engine, and this technical instruction you are reading right now. %nThis is not a barren planet. First you have to survive. Find something to eat first, and I'll give you some potatoes for you to plant. %n%n Important: click the detect/submit button to finish the item check for the quest! %n%n Also Important: Crown shaped quests are the main quests that unlock the next tier, rounded quests are the side quests. %n%n Lastly, but also IMPORTANT: The quests that begin with "Tier" are the "main tech line", and you must complete these to progress in this pack. However, other task lines also contain a lot of interesting contents! %n%nNote: Please read the description of each task carefully, they took a lot of time (and a lot of effort to translate too!)
tfr.quest4.name=Cut down a tree
tfr.quest4.desc=As you may have already discovered, your strength has weakened, and the trees of this world can no longer be mined with bare hands. You need to make a stone axe head to cut down a tree. Fortunately, all you have to do is break the bottom log and then the whole tree will fall.
tfr.quest5.name=§ § §lThe lost art
tfr.quest5.desc=With the stone anvil, you can begin to forge metal. But the lower tiers anvil can only work with limited tiers of metal, so weld the copper ingots with the stone anvil to make the better copper anvil. %n%n TFC has many tiers of anvils. Each higher tier is capable of more complex metalworking than previous tier. Each anvil can weld ingots of the next tier together to form double ingots. All other forgings must be done on an anvil made of equal or higher tier than the tier of the ingredients. %n%nExample: The stone anvil can only weld copper ingots. The copper anvil can weld copper ingots and bronze ingots. %n%nYou can recycle metal anvils in the crucible.%n%n§6§nFor this task you only need to make any variant of the bronze anvil to complete it.
tfr.quest6.name=Advanced Crafting Table
tfr.quest6.desc=The Advanced crafting table is a non-essential but useful device. It has an internal fluid buffer, which allows player to pipe fluid and draw it out through the top slot in its GUI.It will automatically extract items from the storage space next to it. It also has a drawer, which can also hold a lot of things, and special slots for tools. Strongly recommended!
tfr.quest7.name=Want to cut down a tree?
tfr.quest7.desc=With stones, you can enter the Paleolithic age. %n%nTo cut down a tree, you need a stone axe, not a hand. Now make some stone tool heads. %n%nWhen you hold two or more stones, right-clicking will open up the knapping GUI to shape a stone into the tool head. %n%nThe tool head can then be attached to a stick to create a stone tool. Armor, chisel, mace, pick, mining pick, saw, sickle, and sword can't be made of stone.
tfr.quest8.name=Stone Anvil
tfr.quest8.desc=The stone anvil is obtained by right clicking on an igneous intrusive or igneous extrusive rock with a hammer. It will have a dent when compared to other stones. Right-click the anvil to open the GUI and place the hammer inside so that the anvil won't revert to a regular stone. %n%nIntrusive rocks: diorite, gabbro, granite %nIgneous rocks: andesite, basalt, dacite, rhyolite
tfr.quest9.name=Scales: Sliced Food
tfr.quest9.desc=Weights are needed to cut food accurately for consumption
tfr.quest10.name=Smelting Ore
tfr.quest10.desc=Ceramic vessels (also known as pottery jars) can be used to refine primary copper, tetrahedrite or malachite to produce pure copper. To do this, store the ore in a pot (different minerals can be put in the same pot to make alloy) and then heat it in a clay kiln. %n%nAfter firing, retrieve the jar from the kiln and right-click it to open its GUI. Now you'll see that instead of the usual four slots, the jar has only one slot and contains info about the amount of metal it contains. Be careful though, the metal will remain in liquid form for only about 10 minutes. If the metal inside solidifies, you have to put it back into a kiln to melt it down again. %n%nNote: cans with molten metal inside will have a white "liquid" tooltip. %n%nRight click with the vase in hand when you are ready to pour the metal into formms. Put the pickaxe mold or other molds into the GUI that opens, and you can get your first metal pickaxe!%n%n=============================   %n%nCeramic vessels also can be used to make bronze, black bronze, and bismuth bronze. %n%nPlace the necessary ore in a ceramic vessel with proper ratio to make the desired copper alloy. For example, if you want to make ordinary bronze, you can put copper ore (any native copper, malachite or tetrahedrite) and cassiterite in ceramic vessels. For each alloy, there is a range of ratios you can meet to produce the desired alloy, so as long as you are within the range, you don't have to reach the exact ratio.
tfr.quest11.name=§b§lMetal Smelting
tfr.quest11.desc=Want to temporarily say farewell to the anvil processing? This GregTech cauldron is your best helper. Note: this crucible cannot process the original ore you dug! You must process the raw ore into crushed ore/washed ore/ore powder, or turn them into single metallic substance before you can melt it. For now, the crucible's biggest use will be making alloys. The crucible made it easier to make complex alloys such as black, blue and red steel. Usage: first, put the combustion chamber under the crucible, put the mold on the same y level,next to the crucible. Drop the desired metal ingredients into the crucible and then feed(right click) the combustion chamber with any fuel such as coal, wood, etc. Next, right-click the combustion chamber with GT fire starter and there is a chance of starting the fire. Next, you need to wait for the metal to melt in the crucible, or for the alloy mixture to change color. Right - click the mold with your hand/wrench to get the metal. After the metal solidifies, right click again to retrieve the metal. You'll get burned if you don't use the wrench. There is a melting temperature cap in the description of %n%n crucible, if the temperature of the crucible exceeds this cap, the crucible will melt (the surrounding blocks will not be damaged, but your crucible will disappear). After this task, I suggest you first look at the temperature task next to it. %n%n molds can be made into various shapes, such as plates, ingots, rods, and gears with chisels. You can look up the tutorials for that. The exported metal product is base on the shape you make. For example, the plate is an empty out mold. This will save you a lot of time.
tfr.quest12.name=§ § §lBoiling water!
tfr.quest12.desc=Your first steam production device in this journey. It's time to boost productivity! Although you can enter the age of steam after the completion the black steel anvil, I would suggest that you complete the red steel anvil or blue steel anvil task line, so that you can obtain the GT crucible, a strong tool that can boost your production, otherwise you would be extremely short of materials in the age of steam. Note: you will notice that the task is now divided into two  branches, bronze and steel. You can choose the side you want, you can progress as long as you complete the crown shape task.%n
tfr.quest13.name=§ §lb  wrought iron anvil
tfr.quest13.desc=You realize that if you want to further improve your metal processing, bronze grade anvil seems a little inadequate. Now with your newly obtained ingot of wrought iron, you think it is strong enough to weld steel ingots or process wrought iron.
tfr.quest14.name=Primitive blast furnace
tfr.quest14.desc=The minimum version of the blast furnace structure is as follows :%n%nC=crucible B= furnace F =firebrick W= bellows A = air %n%n % first layer :%nAAA%nAAA%nABW%nAAA%n %n %n% third layer :%nAFA%nFAF%nAFA%nFAF%nn %n§lThe black dot of the bellows must be facing the blast furnance at %n%n %n%n§lwrought iron plates are attached to the sides of all firebricks %n§ O § § O § N how to make steel :%n%n1.Place an air nozzle in the blast furnace. To make steel from a blast furnace, the ore must be thrown from the top of the blast furnace with the same amount of flux and the same or more amounts of charcoal. Each layer of the blast furnace can process four pieces of ore. Then set the blast furnace block on fire with some fire starters. %n Beware: in order to maintain high temperatures, it is recommended to maintain a charcoal to ore ratio of 1:1 or higher(excluding the first charcoal). If there is more ore than charcoal, the temperature will start to drop. Blast furnace GUI can be opened by right-clicking the blast furnace block. Thermometer: this shows the temperature of the blast furnace.The temperature can be raised by adding more charcoal or placing bellows on both sides of the blast furnace. Ore: How much unmelted ore is in the blast furnace. Charcoal: How much charcoal is in the blast furnace. Only charcoals can be used in the blast furnace! Note: make sure this bar is always equal to or higher than the ore bar! The ratio of charcoal to ore needs to be at least 1:1. With the bellows, the temperature will be kept high enough for the ore to begin to melt. The ore counter will eventually run out and fill the output counter with the finished metal. Continue heating until the iron ore melts and flows into cauldrons underneath to receive liquid pig iron. You need to use a ceramic mold to remove the melted pig iron.Just a few steps left. Forge pig iron into high carbon steel ingot on a wrought iron or better anvil. Lastly, reforge it into steel ingot.%n%n
tfr.quest15.name=One cup of water a day keeps doctor away
tfr.quest15.desc=You notice that you now have a thirst bar. Well, it makes sense, right? %n%nYou can right-click a fresh water block and drink from it directly (fresh water lakes have reeds) or fill this water bottle with water. %n%nEvery time you use a ceramic product, it may break. The odds are different for each product. When things break, they make a crisp sound.%n
tfr.quest16.name=Where does the water come from?
tfr.quest16.desc=A steam boiler will explode when it's dry, so you gotta add water to it... There are two ways to add water, manual and automatic. You need an vanilla minecraft bucket to add water by hand. It's pretty easy to make, but it is very tedious. It's better to use a device to automatically add water to the boiler. %n%n First of all you can use a water tank, one might not be enough, do a few more. %n%n Undistilled water will cause boiler calcification, it is recommended to use a dryer to make distilled water for the boiler.
tfr.quest17.name=§ § §lA steam engine
tfr.quest17.desc=The steam engine is an important machine, face its output at the crucible and it will pump air into the crucible.
tfr.quest18.name=Mass production of steel!
tfr.quest18.desc=Steel is an important raw material. It can be used in combustors, boilers, engines, steam turbines, machinery, and some of the more advanced alloys. %n  A crucible with air from the steam engine can slowly convert iron into steel. (By adding iron to the crucible at a temperature (see NEI for details)). Don't fully fill the cauldron, or the air won't pump in
tfr.quest19.name=Mixing bowl
tfr.quest19.desc=This mixing bowl allows you to make a mixture like glue and clay. Right click the top face of the bowl with an open hand to stir. %n%nBe careful: Don't make the flame recipe when making clay bricks, carve them vertically first, otherwise it will cause crashes.%n
tfr.quest20.name=GaMeR fUEl(better water for boiler)
tfr.quest20.desc=Boiler can be delicate, ordinary water will cause the its calcification. Calcification will lead to decreased efficiency. Calcification can be removed with a chisel, but must be removed when there is no pressure in the boiler or it will explode. %n Quite a B****, isn't it? %n so you need distilled water. Distilled water doesn't calcify the boiler. Distilled water can be obtained by treating fresh water, sea water, sewage and other water-containing liquids and solids with a dryer, and even tungsten trioxide. But the easiest source is fresh water. The water from the TFC can be pumped directly into the dryer instead of the vanilla water.
tfr.quest21.name=FAST FURNACE
tfr.quest21.desc=The recipe is the same as the forge furnace, but each coal can process at least 90 items, and it is extremely fast. It's ten times faster than the vanilla furnace, GregTech OP! %n%n requires the combustion chamber to provide heat directly below
tfr.quest22.name=Making silk(it's originally a dirty joke I believe)
tfr.quest22.desc=%n Cable is made by using wiring machine %n. Usage: place wire drawing board and cable, shift right click pull the capstan.%n%n Add some lubricant makes the process easier(ok this sounds dirty now).
tfr.quest23.name=GOTTA GO FASTTTTTTTTTT!
tfr.quest23.desc=The dryer has multiple versions: steel, Invar, titanium, tungsten carbide. Of course, more advanced dryers require more HU. The Invar dryers are not much more expensive than steel, but they are much faster. %n* I recommend a chrome combustion chamber with a steel dryer, chromium is not too expensive if you can find chromite. If you want to use a titanium chamber, I won't stop you.
tfr.quest24.name=§ §bl sulfuric acid
tfr.quest24.desc=Sulfuric acid is very important, as it's the ingredient of hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid. It can also be used for ore processing and so on. You need to make at least two bronze mixer in order to make it. The first one requires a vent for air, input the sulfur dioxide that you get in the calciner, and 1 platinum powder or vanadium pentoxide (not consumed) to make sulfur trioxide %n%n Use the second mixer for sulfur trioxide and water to make sulfuric acid. The more the better! §4%n%n§r In order to submit the task you need to make a water tank, which can be attached to the output side of the machine to get the liquid. The tank can also be used for  the machine's automatic input so there is no need to worry about wasting the materials. Here you have to submit 16000MB of liquid.
tfr.quest25.name=Generator control panel
tfr.quest25.desc=Small logic circuit, but smart enough to control the generator to produce a steady current.
tfr.quest26.name=Calculations!
tfr.quest26.desc=As you may have noticed, GregTech's machine has a range of power inputs and outputs. In order to run a machine, you need to calculate what kind of power source produces the energy to run the machine. (If a machine is given more energy than its desired power, the extra energy will not be wasted and the machine will automatically oveclock itself)%n%n Note the chromium combustor produces 112HU, using it to power the chrome boiler will blow it up.
tfr.quest27.name=§ §bl turbines
tfr.quest27.desc=Consumes SU(steam) to produces RU%n it outputs distilled water from the side. If no fluid storage or pipe is available, distilled water will be destroyed automatically. %n If the output is up, the entities on it will rotate %n%n not that only the crown shape task is the main task, in other words you can skip the other machines.
tfr.quest28.name=crusher
tfr.quest28.desc=The first machine in mineral processing. A must have.  %n small TFC ores can be obtained through RC rock breaker, but they cannot be smelted directly in GT crucible. So you need to deal with them further. The %n crusher automatically breaks small ore into crushed ore or raw ore into crushed ore, producing twice as much ore as breaking them with a hammer. Either way, it can provide you with an almost eightfold increase in production.(say hi to technology!) But it's made of diamonds. Gotta look for the Kimberlite. Breaking Kimberlite have a chance of dropping diamonds of different qualities, which can be processed by a crusher into a pulverized diamond mine. A Washed diamond mine can be filtered through a sieve to produce diamonds of different qualities. You'll need at least two diamonds to make it. If you can't find the Kimberlite, check out the other quest rewards or the Multipurpose store for diamonds.
tfr.quest29.name=The washing machine
tfr.quest29.desc=The second machine in mineral processing. A must have.%n It will wash smashed ores into washed ones, which will not give you cobblestones when you put them in the crucible. %n You get more byproducts from them with grinding machine or centrifuge.
tfr.quest30.name=Grinding machine
tfr.quest30.desc=The third machine for mineral processing. A must have. %n It will grind your washed ores into powder, better than a mortar. The product powder is 1/72 of a full powder. It is recommended to fill a wooden storage barrels with one unit of powder, and then use a hopper or logistics itempipe to input 1/72  powder, which can then be automatically sorted into 1 unit of the powder. %n if it's too slow, you can make better ones with steel. %n%n Diamond plates can be made by cutting a flawless diamond with a saw or a circular saw
tfr.quest31.name=Siever
tfr.quest31.desc=§9 Sift salt, coal, and gemstone to gain more fine gems byproducts
tfr.quest32.name=§ §bl stainless steel

tfr.quest34.desc=§2§1§ Your first electric device, the beginning of everything
tfr.quest35.name=roaster
tfr.quest35.desc=This machine processes the grinded powder that the grinder produced, which are mostly sulfur compounds, so you can get sulfur dioxide from them, which can be used to make sulfuric acid. However, it needs air or oxygen to run. You need to make a vent attached to its fluid input to input air.
tfr.quest36.name=Gotta smelt it EVEN faster
tfr.quest36.desc=No Description
tfr.quest37.name=Forge
tfr.quest37.desc=Make a 1x1x1 pit where all 5 blocks contacting the pit are some variation of stone.  Place 8 charcoal in the pit (right click 8 times). Then use a fire starter or a flint & steel to make a forge furnace block. %n%nIn the forge GUI, where a ghost coal icon is displayed in the forge furnace, you may place charcoal. The five spots above these are for holding the metal that needs to be heated. As the temperature rises, the color of the metal changes (you can't tell, but it's shown below the item), and the item becomes "workable," then "weldable," then "dangerous." Be careful when the metal goes into the "dangerous" state, as further heating may cause your metal to melt. %n%nWhen the metal becomes liquid, if there is an ingot mould in the five columns on the right, the molten metal will enter the mould; if there is no mould, the metal will disappear directly. If the temperature continues to rise, the metal may be lost entirely.
tfr.quest38.name=Basic electronic circuit (welding completed)
tfr.quest38.desc=Similar to making galvanized steel, an electronic circuit can be obtained by introducing molten solder into a stainless steel dip basin and then dipping a circuit board. It is important to note that there are three types of solder: lead, tin, and brazing alloys (tin and antimony 9:1). If lead or tin is used as solder, the resulting electronic circuit will be 2 and 1 levels lower than the circuit board level, and only brazing alloy can ensure that the electronic circuit level does not drop. Please use molten brazing alloy for welding to avoid unnecessary loss. %n%n%n basic electronic circuits are used to make some LV appliances and also for making distillation columns. The distillation column can produce plastic for rapid production of subgrade panels.

tfr.quest53.name=Hydrochloric acid
tfr.quest53.desc=Hydrochloric acid is not difficult to obtain, you just need to mix sulfuric acid with salt/rock salt. To submit a task, you need to make a water tank, which is attached to the output of the machine to get the liquid. The tank content can also be placed in the machine's automatic input so there is no need to worry about wasting. Here you have to submit 16000MB of liquid.
tfr.quest54.name=Hydrofluoric acid
tfr.quest54.desc=Hydrogen fluoride is difficult to obtain, you need to mix sulfuric acid and fluorspar. In the future, you can also get fluorine by electrolysis. There are many ways to obtain %n%n fluorspar, the most convenient should be washing tin ore. To submit a task, you need to make a water tank, which is attached to the output of the machine to get the liquid. The tank content can also be input back in the machine's automatic input so there is no need to worry about wasting. Here you have to submit 8000MB of liquid.

tfr.quest101.name=The temperature
tfr.quest101.desc=Different crucibles have different melting temperatures, as you can see at Tooltip. This determines the maximum melting point of the metal they can smelt. Ceramic crucible, for example, could not be used to make iridium, but chrome crucible could. It's important to make a crucible with a high melting point, which allows you to make stronger metals. In general, ideal crucible tier progression is ceramic - chrome - iridium. For now, the highest level you can get is iridium. To keep the crucible from melting down, you need to make a thermometer to see the cauldron's temperature in real time. %n%n First prepare a glass bottle, then you need three cinnabar powder, drop it into the crucible, fill it with 144L liquid mercury from the crucible. Drop two planks into the combustion chamber and ignite (you can't drop too much fuel, as mercury evaporates easily), just enough to turn cinnabar into mercury, which is liquid at room temperature, so you don't have to worry about solidifying. You can obtain the mercury bottle by right-clicking the glass bottle directly at the liquid inside the crucible. Now that we've got the thermometer we can monitor the temperature of the cauldron all the time. No more melt downs!

tfr.quest106.name=Burning!!!! ~ ~
tfr.quest106.desc=The combustion chamber. The most direct way to get heat, or HU,which has a lot of uses other than powering the steam boiler. Many of GregTech Tech's machines runs on heat. Until you make an electric heater, you'll need these boys. The heat outpust from the top (HU)%n%n combustion chamber has 3 different types: solid, liquid and gas. The advantages and disadvantages of the three combustors are analyzed here. §4§lsolid combustor uses solid fuel; all fuel that can be used in a furnace (except lava) can be put into a solid combustor and be used as fuel. When you want to stop heating, you need to block the front of the combustion chamber and wait for the current burning fuel to burn out. When using a solid combustion chamber for mineral smelting, be sure to wait for the fire to shut off before pouring. Because the less the contents the crucible has, the faster it heats up-- if the crucible is left empty or near empty while fire is not extinguished, the temperature will rise so rapidly that the crucible will explode (in effect, melt). Suitable for operation that requires long heating period and it's more forgiving, But it's more manually intensive since you need to add fuel and clear ash. Solid combustion Chambers are not recommended after the distillation tower has been built. §2§lliquid combustion chamber, the safest and most stable combustor, uses combustible liquids: the best you can get right now is creosote (wines, creosote, and petroleum distillates are good for combustion, other oils have low burn values). Since the flammable liquid burns 1L/1ticks, when you want to stop heating, you just block the front to stop the heating immediately. When a mineral is smelted in a liquid combustion chamber, the heating can be stopped at a temperature higher than the standard temperature to prevent solidification during the pouring process. %n%n§9§lgas combustor lasts the longest. The burn value of propane butane is slightly higher than the burn value of gasoline and other petroleum distilling products, and each combustion USES 5~7L to burn 30~42ticks, so the shutdown will be delayed by about one second. Suitable for distillation tower, steam boiler and other task that requires long-term heating. Note: depending on the type of oil, change your startegy accordingly. Heavier oil produce less gas products, more liquid and solid products.

tfr.quest227.name=fruit
tfr.quest227.desc=Fruits are obtained in two ways: berry bushes and fruit trees, both of which can be found in the wild. %n Berry bushes can be gathered directly by hand and cannot reproduce. When the shrub is in season and in the right temperature range, it can produce a new fruit every month. Each berry has a different life span, and at the end of that life span, the fruit is removed from the bush. To harvest the fruit, just right-click on the bush and the fruit will drop. The harvested weights vary from 3 to 8 ounces. There is a chance of getting a sapling by chopping it down with an axe. If the trunk is left, it can continue to grow, multiply and produce more. %n%n tree seedlings do not grow immediately. On the contrary, the fruit trees grow slowly, with branches and leaves coming out in stages. This means that the saplings will eventually grow back after the branches have been cut off for harvest. But it also means that saplings take a long time to grow into trees as big as those in the wild. The trunk will reach its maximum height after 30 days, with a branch every 20 days and a leaf every two days. At harvest time, the tree will have a fruit on each leaf. To harvest the fruit, right-click on the leaves or left-click on the leaves and the fruit will fall. Fruit per serving is 4 to 16 ounces. %n%n fruit trees bear fruit only when the current temperature is between 0 and 38.

The exact value of these interactions varies from species to species, and some require more interaction. Familiarity can be improved by performing specific actions every 24 game hours. To raise an animal, the player must sneak around to provide food so that the animal does not get spooked. If intimacy does not reach 30% and the animal does not interact with the human within 24 hours, then intimacy will decline. Adult animals are limited in their ability to be domesticated, only small animals can be fully domesticated, and intimacy increases faster. Young animals retain 50 per cent of their mother's closeness at birth, unless she is close to the maximum, in which case they will retain 90 per cent. %n%n Stealthily looking at an animal displays a closeness indicator. As the intimacy increases, the indicator will fill with red, and when it reaches 100%, it will turn gold. A white border means that the animal has reached at least 30% and intimacy is no longer diminished. %n%n Sex: %n%n animals (excluding squid) have different sex (male or female), which is determined randomly at the time of animal generation. With the exception of bears, horses and wolves, all animals have visual cues to easily determine sex, such as horns, teeth, breasts and different feather colors. For creatures with no visual cues, players can right click on the animal, and the chat window will indicate gender.
tfr.quest275.name=Animal husbandry: Reproduction
tfr.quest275.desc=All reproducible animals except chickens are bred by bringing together animals of different genders and feeding them until heart-shaped particles begin to appear. The animals consumed 5 ounces of grain each time they were fed, and if both animals had the heart, they would approach within seconds of the particles disappearing. A successful breeding can be confirmed by right-clicking on the female animal, which will produce a chat message, "pregnant". %n % chicken %n%n chickens are bred by using nesting boxes. The hen will lay an egg in the nest box every day. If there is a rooster in the box, the egg will be fertilized. A fertilized egg has a hint of fertilization on it. After three quarters of a month in the nest, the fertilized eggs hatch into chicks. Note: This calculation is based on months, not days. So a world with a long month will have a longer incubation period because there are more days in a month. %n%n pregnancy and baby %n%n all reproducible animals except chickens, the female will become pregnant directly after breeding. Once a female becomes pregnant, she must pass through pregnancy before giving birth. Note: This calculation is based on months, not days. Therefore, longer months will lead to longer pregnancies. %n%n When the time of conception is complete, the female gives birth. The length of pregnancy, the length of adulthood, and the number of offspring born depend on the type of animal.%n
tfr.quest276.name=Charcoal
tfr.quest276.desc=(If you don't have a home yet, come back to this task later) %n%nHow does one make charcoal? You need a charcoal pit! %n%nSneak with a log in your hand and right click to get a pile of logs. Click again with an empty hand to put in up to 16 logs. The smallest version of a charcoal pit is a single pile of wood with four logs to ensure that at least one piece of charcoal is produced. In general, you want many piles of wood together.  There is no maximum. %n%nCover the wood with dirt or gravel.  Make a hole in the top of the pile, and drop a torch on the exposed log pile to ignite it. Then seal it with dirt. %n%nPlayers will have about 10 seconds after the fire ignites to close the pit entirely. %n%nOnce the charcoal pit catches fire, it must be covered with any non-flammable solid blocks keep it smouldering. Any exposed pile of logs will burn and eventually drop the logs, causing the process to fail. If the process is successful, smoke particles will be released from the covered pit. After 18 hours of play time, the smoke particles will dissipate and the smouldering logs will be turned into charcoal blocks that can be harvested one at a time with a shovel. Note: Only a full log pile can have another log pile on it, so plan the height accordingly. %n%nIf there is a gravitation affected block in the top layer of the pit, such as dirt or cobblestone, these blocks will collapse because air blocks are created when logs turn into charcoal. Most of the larger charcoal pits are made of stone and brick to provide a more durable structure.
tfr.quest277.name=Scientific glazing technology
tfr.quest277.desc=To make glass, you have the option of mining borax or making rough caustic soda. See NEI for specific fabrication methods. %n%nOriginal sand can be obtained by shapeless crafting.
tfr.quest278.name=Automatic air blast
tfr.quest278.desc=By putting charcoal and fresh water in a steam furnace, firing it, and giving a red stone signal, he was able to provide kinetic energy to adjacent bellows drives.   %n%n bellows drive may drive the bellows if adjacent to the bellows. %n%n The blast frequency can be adjusted by right-clicking the hammer on the steam furnace. There is a constant blast of air to make steel.
tfr.quest279.name=Smelting iron ore
tfr.quest279.desc=Open the opening of the forge and place eight pieces of charcoal at the bottom of the chimney. %n%n climb to the top of the forge and drop 24 iron ore (depending on its size) into the chimney. %n%n throw equal or more charcoal over the lump of charcoal. Both the ore and the charcoal should disappear into the lump of charcoal. %n%n Note: if the player throws more ore than the forge can hold, the extra ore floats on the charcoal instead of melting. %n%n Activate the forge by right clicking on the forge block with the starter or flint. The tops of forge iron stoves and chimneys should begin to glow. %n%n When it's done, the glow disappears, and the process takes about 15 game hours. Open the forge iron furnace to obtain the iron billet. %n%n use a pick to break the iron. This item will automatically move to the nearest forge box for easy pickup. %n%n%n billet is a porous mixture of iron and slag produced by smelting iron ore in a forge iron furnace. The product of a forge iron furnace is a cast iron billet. The iron content of a cast iron billet will have a percentage value, of which 1 percent is equal to one metal unit (100 units of ore will produce 100 percent of the billet, corresponding to a wrought iron ingot). Note: If not enough ore is added to the forge, its iron percentage will be less than 100%, then it cannot be refined and must be put back into the forge to add more ore. Next, you need to refine, shard, and beat the cast iron billets with an anvil of bronze grade or higher.   you will get your first wrought iron. Please cool the forging iron ingot in the bucket in order to submit the task

tfr.quest284.desc=Tanks are a relatively inexpensive and efficient option for storing liquids and gases. In the early stage, we could only make a simple wooden storage tank with a capacity of 8000L. In fact, you just need to use a bone glue and add water to a mixing bowl, and then right click on the bottle to take out the bottle. %n%n After we can make stainless steel, we can choose the right amount to make several stainless steel tanks, cost-effective, capacity 64000L, no leakage (can store liquid), corrosion resistance (can store sulfuric acid and other corrosive liquid). The most cost-effective storage tank is plastic, which comes from petroleum fractionation. Six ingot quantities of plastic are put into the mould press and a steel cryogenic treatment mould (small unit mould), which can be used to make the plastic storage tank with 32000L capacity and no air leakage. Note: the storage tank has a temperature limit. Please do not hold the liquid at too high temperature, or the tank will be destroyed.

tfr.quest460.name=What should I dig for?
tfr.quest460.desc=After getting your first pick, you can mine ore from the rock instead of collecting the ore nuggets from the earth's surface. %n%nAfter finding nuggets on the ground, you can use the prospecting pick (propick) I gave you, right click on the dirt nearby, and feedback text will tell you how much minerals there are. %n%nThe propick works on a 25x25x25 cube centered on the square you hit. %n%nPersonal recommendation on how to use it:%n%nFirst locate a location that shows "A very large sample". (if there is no very large sample at the surface, you may need to dig down)%n%nNext choose a direction, such as the x axis, and continue prospecting in this line, until you get a reading other than "very large sample"%n%nFor example, let's say that you get a "very large sample" at x=190 and x=210, but everything west of 190 and east of 210 is "large sample" or smaller.  In this example, the center of the vein would be where x = 200.%n%nAfter you have discovered the center of the vein with regard to x, do the same again with regards to z.  Do this by prospecting north and south in a line where your x-center was.%n%nAfter you have the center of the vein, dig down until you find the ore.%n%nPlease note that the propick frequently gives false negatives.  When you see that the pick finds nothing, it just means that block will never give information.  You'll have to work with the information you do get, and ignore the negatives.  Likewise, sometimes the pick will find a different vein than what you searching for.  In fact, having too many other types of veins in the same area can make prospecting very difficult.%n%nThis process works well on flat land without other veins around.  In most cases, you will have hills that interfere.  Remember that you can use your pick on any solid block.  You may need flatten some terrain in some cases.%n%nIt is recommended that you use mine copper, coal, tin, zinc, and bismuth in Tier 1.  You will need a large amount of iron starting in tier 3, so it won't hurt to pick it up also if you find it.
